                 <h3>Depending on what you want to do with the links, there are many ways to collect and assemble them. 
                 	For example, if the links are meant to be used to navigate a website then it would make sense that they are a part of some navigation element of a page. If the links are meant to be shared as a collection of resources, perhaps a list or a table might make more sense. </h3>

                 <h2><small class="text-muted">How can we best describe the syntax of HTML? of CSS? 
                 <h3>HTML is made up of a bunch of elements known as tags with various content and properties. It is the composition of these elements (tags) that ultimately create what is viewable by a user. A browser is designed specifically to interpret
                 these tags and mark-ups according to some standard.</h3>
                 <br>
                 <h3>CSS is a way of defining the style (the look) of the elements in HTML. CSS shares some similarities with HTML syntax where the elements are ultimately described by tags. CSS also allows for a bit more fine-tuning as you can target specific elements using the built-in syntax. For example, you can target specific elements or apply style to all elements that are of the same type (tags). </h3>

					Content such as contrast, balance, usability etc can be explored and ellaborated upon. You can also assign a mini project that would ask students to prove their knowledge of basic tags and styling.</h3>
